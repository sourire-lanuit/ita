And I am, an absolute stranger, a bandit – from one terminology and insurgent – from other terminology, 
I am simply and clearly staring at these portraits and in my soul 
I don’t have and will never have such anger. And it’s understandable:

I am security officer but I am human too.

Dark night, when beyond the window city nights pass, 
when blue mist rises above brickyard and citizens, like the mice, go for gateway, 
in canary-yellow castle, dark night in my incredible closet gathering my friends. 
This is new Sanhedrim, this is the black commune‘s court-martial.

Then from every single corner peers real and horrible death. Inhabitant:
-Here is living sadism!

I:
-…(silent)

On the town’s tower beyond pass is anxiously ringing copper. 
It is a chime. From a dark field I can hear muted cannonade.

My acquaintances are sitting by a wide table made of black wood. 
Silence. I can hear only how the station horn is playing his music again. 
Sometimes you can see insurgents beyond the window.

It’s easy to recognize my friends:

A doctor Tagabat,

Andryusha,

And…degenerate (faithful watchman on the chats).

This is a full black court-martial.
